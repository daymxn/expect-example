# `@rbxts/expect` Extension Library Example

An example of what an extension library using [@rbxts/expect](https://github.com/daymxn/rbxts-expect) would look like.

The `library` directory contains a project that _publishes_ the extension `@rbxts/expect-rust-types`.

The `consumer` directory contains a project that _uses_ the extension `@rbxts/expect-rust-types`.

Both of these libraries should help provide you with the context you need to understand
how to create an extension library, and how people will use that extension library.

To learn more about extension libraries, and how they work, take a look at the
[Extension Libraries Guide](https://rbxts-expect.daymxn.com/docs/category/extension-libraries).
